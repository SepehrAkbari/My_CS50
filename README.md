# My CSC50 Journey

I've loved the three CS50 courses I've taken, here's what I did:

- [CS50's Programming with Python](https://github.com/SepehrAkbari/My_CS50/tree/main/CS50-P)
- [CS50's Intro to Computer Science](https://github.com/SepehrAkbari/My_CS50/tree/main/CS50-X)
- [CS50's Programming with R](https://github.com/SepehrAkbari/My_CS50/tree/main/CS50-R)
